## How to collect debris

There are many ways you can contribute to cleaning up ocean debris.

### Carry In Out
Many beaches have a Carry-in Carry-Out policy. You might see less than anticipated trash barrells.  The emphasis is to leave with what you brought. Leave nothing but your footprints.

### Volunteer
There are plenty of organizations that spend just 1-2 hours at a time cleaning marine debris. Check out our Network page to join a group.

### Remind Others
Share this site on Social Media. Tell friends and family what you learn about marine debris, and educate others
