We all can do our part to make our beaches clean. It's as simple as being a *C.R.a.B*!

## 1. Collect
See something? Pick it up! Don't just ignore that empty can or other [debris]({% link debrise.md %}) laying in the sand. Collect it and move it off the beach, before the ocean does.

Check out other ways you can COLLECT beach debris.

## 2. Remove
When you head to the beach be sure to follow the golden rule: carry-in, carry-out.  After your day in the sun, check to make sure you've gathered all of your belongings and deposited all of your recycling and garbage.

## 3. and.. Beautify!
Leave the beach better then you found it! Ask yourself what is the one thing you could do at your beach trip to make that beach better for someone else.
